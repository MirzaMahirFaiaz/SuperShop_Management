First, we need to create the database named 'SuperShop' in MS SQL and some tables that are mentioned in the 
SQL/Super_Shop_Database_Query_Only_ Table_Create file. We just need to run those queries. Then open the project folder name 
'ShekorShop_Management' in NetBeans 8.2 version to run the project. Before running the project, we need to set the paths of jar files in 
the Library section. We also need to set the pdf generation path in the 'SellingProducts.java' file under the 'Save' Button in 670 number
line as different pc/laptop has different path.
